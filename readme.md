### What is Git

People call git time-traveling, others call it a miracle, but the truth is, Git is a *version manager*. This means that Git helps us keep track of things in our projects.

### Glossary

* ```mkdir``` make a directory
* ```touch``` create a file
* ```cat``` output content of a file
* ```cd``` change directory 
* ```vi``` enter text editor vi
* ```ls``` list directory contents

###Installation
If you're on a Windows machine, then you should go to:

#### [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

I recommend downloading GitBash (which comes with the installation) as well to have a more *nix terminal and make things easier.

If you're on a *nix machine, such as Linux or OSX, then you've got nothing to worry about, git already comes with your machine. 

In case you want to update it, or in the unusual case it's not there, then run:

Linux
```console
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install git
```
OSX
```console
$ brew install git
$ brew upgrade git
```

##### Small note on the ```brew``` command:
Brew stands for Homebrew, a very nice package manager, specifically for OSX, this PM will help you in the future, for installing things like databases, like Postgres, programming languages, like Ruby, and version managers, like RVM. 

You can download it here: [HOMBREW](http://brew.sh/).

###Initializing Git

Alright, you've got git in your machine, so now let's start using it.

This is going to be a mini-tutorial on how to use git, so we'll make a small repository.

First let's make our folder. (I'll use my personal directory path but you an use your own):

```console
$ cd Docmuents/Playground/Projects
```

Once inside your workspace directory, we'll create a folder to place all of our things for this tutorial.

```console
$ mkdir git_tutorial && cd git_tutorial
```

Great! Now, let's initialize our git project via:

```console
$ git init
```
You should get a message like 

```console
Initialized empty Git repository in /Documents/Playground/Proyectos/git_tutorial/.git/
```

You should see something like this:

![Init](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oelizondo/learn-git/master/git_init.png)

Perfect, now let's create a simple text file with a classic Hello Wold

```console
$ touch hello.txt && vi hello.txt
```

Don't be scared by the last command, we just told our command line, or terminal, to enter the *vi* editor to add some text to our file.
Remember to press *i* to enter *insert* mode and start typing.

![Init](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oelizondo/learn-git/master/hello_txt.png)

After that we can exit vi pressing *esc* and *:wq* (wq stands for *write* and *quit*), press enter and you should be back in your terminal.
We can check our text file typing:

If you're in Windows, any text editor will do, like notepad.

```console
$ cat hello.txt
```

```cat``` outputs the content of the file you typed in.

Now it's time for our first commit. Commits are basically a snapshot of your project, like a picture or a save point. You can always go back to a specific commit, but we'll see that later. First, let's check the project's status to see which file are pending to be added.

```console
$ git status
```

You should see:

![Init](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oelizondo/learn-git/master/git_status.png)


That means that *hello.txt* has not been added to the git project yet, so let's do that with a command to add *all* the files in our project:

```console
$ git add -A
```

You can add individual files:

```console
$ git add hello.txt
```

After that we are good to go, let's commit our text file:

```console
$ git commit -m "Adds text file to project"
```

the *-m* command is for attaching a message to your commit, to it's easier to see what happened in that save point.

###Branching out

Alright, we have our project rolling, it's time to introduce Branches. Branches allows you create a clone of your project under a different name that's not master, and let's you keep working with a different version of the project without contaminating the master branch. This is useful when we work with other people. Imagine a team of two persons, each branching out from master to his or her own branch and work from there to avoid conflicts with each other.

####The dev branch

Before anything else, we need to create a dev branch. the Dev branch allows us to break, refactor, add, and delete as much code as we need before sending it to production, or a *final result*, which almost always is *master*. After all the code has been verified in Dev, we can merge it with master and push it.

```console
$ git checkout -b dev
```

![Init](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oelizondo/learn-git/master/git_checkout.png)


Now we have a copy of our project in another branch. It's  time to modify it! It's good practice to have a separate branch for a feature, component, test or functionality. Right now we're in Dev, so we're going to create a new branch called *feature/website* and have a simple html file there.

```console
$ git checkout -b feature/website
```

Then we create our HTML file:

```console
$ touch index.html
```

The content is in this link:

* [Simple Website structure](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/oelizondo/d5b95e661878135feeb6/raw/dc2893cb0066dd3c8cf127bf5cbf10e6f8a1bbef/index.html)

Just copy and paste it with any text editor.

###Verifying and merging branches

Great! Now it's time to make our new commit. Same as before:

```console
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Adds website to project"
```

Awesome, now it's time to *merge* our branches. Merging just means we take one branch and combine it with another one. We're going to merge it into Dev right now, here's how it would look like:

```console
$ git checkout dev
```

If we do

```console
$ ls
```

We'll see that the *index.html* file is no there! Not to worry, this is because our *index.html* is in another branch, and we're going to bring it over here.

```console
$ git merge feature/website
```

![Init](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oelizondo/learn-git/master/git_merge.png)

Now, repeating the *ls* command will show us our *index.html* file. Pretty cool, huh?

**Good practice**
It's good practice to first verify that the external branch (in this case feature/website) works correctly. Maybe right now it's not obvious, but in a Rails application, for example, we should make sure all our tests are passing before merging an important feature into dev, and more importantly, master.

###Git log

Seems like we did a lot, but let's go back to see what we actually did. Wait, how do we do that?

Git is awesome enough that it keeps track of everything we do, kind of like a log (not a wooden one). If we type

```console
$ git log
```

![Init](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oelizondo/learn-git/master/git_log.png)


we can see:

* The commit Id
* The author of the commit
* When was the commit made
* The message that comes with the commit

This is very useful and we can keep track of *who* does *what* and *when*. Remember when I told you we can hop to different commits in case somebody commited some buggy code? We totally can:

```console
git checkout <commit_id>
```

This will send us back in time to that specific point of our project and allow us to fix that buggy code nobody likes.

###Git stash

This is a more specific feature of git, but let's say you're in *feature/website* and some coworker asks you to do something in *dev*. That's fair, but you're not finished working in your branch, and to change back to *dev* you'd have to make a silly commit with work that's not done. This is where *git stash* comes in. Git stash let's you put your code in a *hold* state, and you can move around without affecting the paused files. We just:

```console
$ git stash
```

This sends everything into a queue list, and *pauses* your branch, allowing you to switch over to dev and continue working. When coming back to *feature/website* then you should just

```console
$ git stash pop
```

To resume your work.

###Github and Github Pages

Alright, you're probably wondering by now how to upload your repository to Github and have many stars. I'll tell you, if you're reading this then you're already here in github, so go ahead and click the big green button that says **+ New repository**. Name it (whatever you want), add a description and click the create button.

The next screen is kinda scary, but no fear, we only need the middle option **â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line**

Before we can push anything though, we need to merge with *master*, remember? Go ahead and commit everything you have in *dev*, and merge to *master* (No tutorial this time, your turn!).

Now we just copy paste:

```console
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:<your_username>/<your_repository>.git
$ git push -u origin master
```
If it's your first time using git, then you'll be prompted to add your email and username. This is fine, it's for git and github to know who you are, so go ahead and follow *those* instructions.

And there we go, you just published your first project on Github!

Great, now we want to publish our website. Wait, what!? But I have to pay for that! Don't worry, Github gives us free hosting of our websites. You can check the whole documentation here: [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

For now, let's go ahead and checkout a new branch called *gh-pages*

```console
$ git checkout -b gh-pages
```
Now we just push

```console
$ git push -u origin gh-pages
```

And we're done! Our website should be published in just a minute.

###Good Practices and Naming Conventions

Some good practices:

* Always create a dev / mvp / staging branch from master so you can work without worries.
* Name your branches short and sweet, prefix them with the purpose of that branch *feauture/user_aunthentication*, *test/users_spec*.
* After making sure your branch is working, merge it to dev and then delete that branch. This avoids having unused left-over data.
* Remember to commit useful messages. Don't make a "lol" commit message. What if another developer has to join your team and must read through your code base?

Feel free to add any other good practices you feel necessary! How? like this:

###Contributing to other projects.

1. Clone project.
2. Checkout a new branch for your changes.
3. Make your changes.
4. Do ```git push -u origin <your_branch>```
5. Create a pull request from your banch to ```spanish``` or ```master```.

###Todo
* Translate to Spanish.
